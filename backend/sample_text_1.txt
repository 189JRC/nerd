Spanish police searching for missing British teenager Jay Slater were today scouring caves close to a ravine in a fresh area of the remote national park where his phone last pinged.

Jay, 19, vanished without trace on the morning of June 17 after enjoying the last night of a three-day rave at the Papagayo Beach Club in the party resort town of Playa de las Americas with his friends. 

After going back to an Airbnb in the remove village of Masca with two men he had had met on holiday, Jay was last seen at 8.15am walking uphill in the Parque Rural de Teno, in the north-western region of the island.

He then phoned his friend Lucy Mae Law at 8.50am to tell her that he was 'tired, thirsty and disorientated' with only one per cent battery left on his phone. 

Spanish police have been using helicopters and drones in the national park, near to a location where Jay's phone last pinged.
