As the search for missing teenager Jay Slater enters its 12th day, an expert has warned that several tourists vanish in Tenerife and are never found.

SOS Disappeared in Tenerife coordinator, Santiago Carlos Mart√≠n, said: "There are many who have disappeared in the Canary Islands and the number has increased since the pandemic."

Tenerife has the second-highest number of missing people in the whole of Spain. According to figures from the Spanish Ministry of the Interior, between 2020 and 2023, at least 460 adults went missing in the Canary Islands, from a population of just 2.2million.

It comes after a grim admission by a local that it could "take months for police to find a body" for those missing in the mountains. The woman, named Anita, said people go missing in these areas "every summer".
